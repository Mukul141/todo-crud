# Todo Service API üìù

Welcome to the Todo Service API\! This is a simple yet powerful RESTful API for managing a to-do list, built with Java and the Spring Boot framework. This project serves as a practical demonstration of modern backend development, from local containerization to cloud deployment.

The goal is to build a robust, well-tested, and scalable service following best practices in the software development lifecycle.

-----

## \#\# Current Features ‚ú®

The API currently supports full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for todo tasks, complete with input validation and standardized error handling.

  * `GET /api/todo-tasks` - Fetches all tasks.
  * `GET /api/todo-tasks/{id}` - Fetches a single task by its ID.
  * `POST /api/todo-tasks` - Creates a new task.
  * `PUT /api/todo-tasks/{id}` - Updates an existing task.
  * `DELETE /api/todo-tasks/{id}` - Deletes a specific task by its ID.
  * `DELETE /api/todo-tasks` - Deletes all tasks.

## \#\# Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

This project is built using a modern and widely-used set of technologies:

  * **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot 3
  * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
  * **Build Tool:** Apache Maven
  * **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose
  * **Testing:** JUnit 5 & MockMvc

-----

## \#\# Getting Started Locally üöÄ

You can get the entire application, including the database, up and running on your local machine with a single command\!

### Prerequisites

  * Git
  * Docker and Docker Compose
  * A Java 17 JDK (for code completion in your IDE)

### Quick Start Guide

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Launch the application:**
    Run the following command from the root of the project. This will build the application's Docker image and start both the app and database containers in the background.

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    That's it\! The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

3.  **To stop the application:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

-----

## \#\# Testing ‚úÖ

This project uses JUnit 5 and MockMvc for robust integration testing of the API controllers. Tests cover both successful "happy path" scenarios and "unhappy path" validation failures.

You can run all tests locally from the command line:

```bash
mvn verify
```

Tests are also automatically executed by the **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** on every push to the `main` branch.

## \#\# Project Roadmap & Future Goals üó∫Ô∏è

This project is still evolving\! Here's a look at what's been done and what's next:

  * [x] **Validation & Error Handling:** Implement robust input validation and a global exception handler for clean error responses.
  * [x] **Unit & Integration Testing:** Write comprehensive tests using JUnit 5 and MockMvc to ensure the API is reliable.
  * [x] **Continuous Integration (CI):** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build and test the code on every push to the `main` branch.
  * [ ] **Cloud Deployment:** Deploy the application as a containerized service to **Google Cloud Run**.
  * [ ] **Performance Testing:** Use **k6** to run a load test and analyze latency metrics (p50/p95) in Google Cloud Monitoring.
